Goal:
Build a full-stack e-commerce website for Advaya, a brand selling tote bags with a desi aesthetic style. The site must support browsing products, viewing details, adding items to a cart, and checking out via WhatsApp Business API.

🔹 Frontend Stack

React (with Vite + TypeScript) → UI components.

Tailwind CSS → Styling, responsive design, custom color tokens.

Wouter → Client-side routing (/, /shop, /product/:id, /about, /cart).

Radix UI + shadcn/ui → Modals, accordions, drawers.

Lucide React + Font Awesome → Icons for UI + social media.

Google Fonts: “Playfair Display” (headings) + “Inter” (body).

Theme system: CSS variables for desi palette (beige, terracotta, maroon, sage, mustard).

🔹 Backend Stack

Express.js (with TypeScript) → REST API endpoints for products, cart, checkout.

tsx → Run TypeScript files directly.

Endpoints

GET /api/products → Returns product list (from JSON for now).

GET /api/product/:id → Returns product detail.

POST /api/order → Initiates checkout (redirects to WhatsApp API link).

🔹 Database & Data

Use JSON files for now in /data/products.json.

Structure:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Paisley Tote",
    "price": 899,
    "colors": ["beige", "maroon"],
    "printStyle": "paisley",
    "image": "/images/paisley-tote.jpg",
    "description": "Handcrafted paisley tote with eco-friendly cotton",
    "care": "Hand wash, do not bleach"
  }
]


Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (Neon) → Prepared for production migration.

Zod → Validate API responses + request bodies.
