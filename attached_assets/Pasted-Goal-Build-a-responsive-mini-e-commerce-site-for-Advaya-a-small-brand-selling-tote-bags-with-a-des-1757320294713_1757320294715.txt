Goal: Build a responsive mini e-commerce site for Advaya, a small brand selling tote bags with a desi aesthetic. The site should feel modern, minimal, and cultural.

Tech stack (pick one and implement):

Option A (preferred): React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Option B: Plain HTML/CSS/JS (no build step)

Include a README with run instructions for Replit.

Pages/Sections:

Home (Landing)

Hero with lifestyle image, headline: “Advaya — Carry Your Culture”, CTA buttons: Shop Now and Our Story.

Benefits row (Eco-friendly cotton, Handcrafted prints, COD/Easy returns).

Instagram-style gallery strip (grid of 6 images with hover).

Shop

Product grid (cards 2–3 per row). Hover lift + shadow.

Filters (Price: Low–High, Print: block-print/paisley/mandala, Color).

Search box.

Product Detail

Large image with zoom on hover.

Title, price, rating, short description.

Collapsible sections: Fabric & Care, Size, Shipping/Returns.

Add to Cart button.

Cart Drawer

Slides in from right. List items, qty +/- , subtotal, Checkout.

Cart must persist in localStorage.

Checkout button opens WhatsApp with pre-filled order text:
https://wa.me/<YOUR_NUMBER>?text=I%20want%20to%20order%20{{items}}%20from%20Advaya

About / Story

Short brand story: sustainable materials, desi craft inspiration.

Footer

Links, email, Instagram handle, copyright.

Design Direction (Desi aesthetic):

Colors:

Beige: #F5EDE1

Terracotta: #C1623C

Mustard: #D6A419

Deep Maroon: #6B1F2A

Sage: #7A8C6D

Charcoal: #2A2A2A

Type:

Headings: a modern serif (e.g., “Playfair Display” or “Cormorant”).

Body: clean sans (e.g., “Inter”).

Patterns & Motifs:

Add a subtle jaali/mandala SVG background for hero or section dividers.

Provide 2 SVGs (tiny size) and a CSS utility class to apply them as repeating patterns at 8–12% opacity.

UI: Rounded corners (lg/2xl), soft shadows, smooth transitions (200–300ms), generous whitespace.

Data & Assets:

Create data/products.json with 8 sample totes:

fields: id, name, price, colors (array), printStyle (blockprint/paisley/mandala), image, description, care

Use royalty-free placeholder image URLs or local /public/images/* placeholders.

Include a favicon and a simple logo wordmark “Advaya” (SVG) using the heading font.

Functionality:

Cart logic: add/remove, quantity, subtotal, localStorage sync.

Filter/search: client-side filter by printStyle, color, and price.

Image zoom: CSS/JS or a small React component.

Accordions: simple accessible component (no heavy deps).

Responsive: Looks great on mobile first, tablet, desktop.

Accessibility: Semantic HTML, aria labels for cart drawer & accordions.

SEO: Title/description meta, OpenGraph tags, schema.org/Product JSON-LD on product detail.

Performance: Lazy-load product images.

Code Quality:

Organize as:
src/components/*, src/pages/* (or sections), src/hooks/*, data/products.json, public/images/*.

Provide constants/theme.ts (or .js) exporting color tokens.

Tailwind config with fonts and color tokens.

Nice-to-Have (if time):

Minimal Framer Motion fade/slide for hero text & cart drawer.

“Back to top” button.

Toast on add-to-cart.

Deliverables:

Complete working app.
